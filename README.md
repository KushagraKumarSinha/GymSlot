# Overview of project

I developed a project for a gym to streamline the management of their new program offering 30-minute one-on-one sessions. Utilizing ReactJS for the frontend, Python for the backend, and SQL Database for data storage. The interface was designed with an intuitive grid layout, showcasing available personal trainers on the x-axis and available time slots on the y-axis. By clicking on a colored square, the respective time slot was automatically assigned, simplifying the scheduling process. Furthermore, users could seamlessly add details to each slot, enhancing organization and efficiency.
